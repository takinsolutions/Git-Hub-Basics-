# Git-Commands

The main goal of the repository is to learn how to add, commit and push changes to the remote repository.
For that need you will need to be able to know how to generate a PAT. If you don't know how to do that, 
please review the <i> Personal-Access-Token-PAT- </i> Repository. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlexMitev21/Personal-Access-Token-PAT-)

## Step 1:

1. Open a terminal, and navigate to your working directory where the project is located
2. You can open a terminal while using the Visual Studio Code, by clicking a new terminal:

&nbsp;

3. Once you have your terminal open you need to run the following commands: 

```
echo "# YOUR_PROJECT_NAME" >> README.md
```
* This command appends the text "# mate1" to a file named "README.md." If the file doesn't exist, it creates the file.
  This is often used to add a title or description to your project's README file.

&nbsp;

```
git init
```
* This initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
  It sets up the necessary data structures and files for version control.
&nbsp;

```
git remote add origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_URL

```
for example:

```
git remote add origin https://AlexMitev21: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@github.com/AlexMitev21/mate1.git
```
* This command adds a remote repository named "origin" with the URL specified. It's configuring your local Git repository to connect to a remote repository on GitHub.
  The URL contains your GitHub username, a Personal Access Token (PAT), and the repository URL.

  &nbsp;

```
git commit -m "first commit"
```
* This command commits the changes made to your Git repository. 
  The -m flag is used to specify a commit message, which briefly describes the changes you made. In this case, the commit message is "first commit."

```
git branch -M main
```
* This renames the default branch of your repository to "main." In Git, the default branch used to be called "master,"
  but it is being replaced with more inclusive terminology, such as "main."

```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
* This is another commit command with a different commit message.
  It commits the staged changes to the Git repository. The commit message is "Initial commit."

```
git push -u origin main
```
* This command pushes the committed changes from your local Git repository to the remote repository on GitHub.
  The -u flag is used to set up a tracking relationship between the local branch "main" and the remote branch "main" on GitHub's "origin" repository.
  It makes it easier to push and pull changes in the future.

By following these instructions, you can now navigate to the actual URL of your repository, so you can see the changes.
